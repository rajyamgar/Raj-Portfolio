            <h2>Highlights of my background include:</h2>
            <p>Earning a Bachelor’s degree in Architecture from Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology Bhopal and a Master’s degree in Urban Planning from CEPT University, Ahmedabad. In the last three years of working in the development sector, I have achieved comprehensive knowledge of urban planning, through an integrated, educational perspective on the political, economic, geographic, social, and cultural character of urban life. Planning and executing various urban planning initiatives through hands-on and operation roles in my job tenure, including working with the government and private organizations give me a lot of experience in citizen engagement, urban and rural planning, research, infrastructure plan preparation, data collection, and statistics.</p>
            <p>My recent work is with INHAF helps me in understanding the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna implementation, where we prepared various analysis reports of existing architecture and construction process and beneficiary selection status from the primary survey, and secondary data for preparation of PMAY benefit assessment report for pan India.  Apart from architecture and planning, I am fond of writing, designing, photography, animation, and programming. Some of my projects were also exhibited and won many  International and National architecture and planning competitions. Recently my thesis project also got funding from SSIP Gujrat to develop an application for solid waste planning in Ahmedabad.</p>
